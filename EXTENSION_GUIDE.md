# Application started. WebSocket server on ws://127.0.0.1:8765
```

**Check 2: Click "Test Connection" button**
- Open extension popup
- Click "Test Connection"
- If it fails, the desktop app isn't running

**Check 3: Try test.html**
- Open `test.html` in browser
- If it connects, extension might need to be reloaded

**Check 4: Reload the extension**
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find "Subtitle Overlay Connector"
3. Click the refresh icon (‚ü≥)
4. Try again
